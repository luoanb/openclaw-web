# AGENTS.md

This repository is designed to be used with coding agents. The goal of this file is to make the project easy for an agent to enter, safe to edit, and easy for a human to review.

本文件是脱敏后的公开版项目地形说明。它不是业务私有规则，也不绑定某台机器、某个账号或某个模型。

## Default Workflow

For everyday coding-agent work, prefer the light workflow first:

- Use `sdd-riper-one-light` for normal coding, documentation, bugfix, refactor, and agentic coding tasks.
- Use `sdd-riper-one` when the task is high-risk, multi-file, cross-module, audit-heavy, or needs explicit handoff.
- For tiny questions or trivial edits, a full protocol is not required.

Core loop:

```text
read context -> restate goal and risk -> checkpoint -> execute -> validate -> reverse sync
```

## Task Package

Do not start from only “implement this” or “fix this”. Before substantial edits, package the task with:

```text
Goal: what should be completed.
Context: what files, docs, logs, specs, or tests should be read first.
Boundary: what may be changed and what should not be touched.
Validation: what evidence proves the task is done.
Recovery: what should be documented or remembered after completion.
```

For small tasks, this can be a few lines. For risky tasks, turn it into a micro spec.

## Before Editing

Before changing code, provide a short checkpoint:

```text
1. Files to change
2. Why these files
3. Minimal implementation plan
4. Explicit non-goals
5. Validation command or evidence
```

If the task is documentation-only and low risk, edits can proceed directly after reading the relevant context.

## Validation

Do not summarize a task as done without evidence.

After edits, report:

```text
1. What changed
2. What validation ran
3. Validation result
4. What target behavior is covered
5. What risk remains uncovered
6. Whether README, AGENTS, skill docs, specs, or examples need updates
```

Use the smallest meaningful validation command first. Broaden validation when the change touches shared behavior or cross-module contracts.

## Reverse Sync

If a task reveals durable knowledge, do not leave it only in chat history.

Consider updating:

- `README.md` or `README.zh-CN.md` for public user-facing behavior.
- `skills/*/README.md` or `skills/*/SKILL.md` for agent workflow behavior.
- `skills/*/references/` for reusable protocol details.
- `skills/*/examples/` for sanitized examples.
- Specs or checklists when the change introduces a repeatable decision or risk.

The goal is to turn useful one-time agent work into reusable project terrain.

## Skill Map

- `skills/sdd-riper-one-light/`
  - Default lightweight harness for strong coding agents.
  - Best for daily coding, fast iteration, checkpoint-based execution, and reverse sync.
- `skills/sdd-riper-one/`
  - More explicit control protocol.
  - Best for complex, high-risk, cross-module, audit, training, or handoff-heavy work.

## 页面与设计（项目约定）

- **页面与组件**：视觉与交互以 `docs/design/BitsUI.md` 为准（Bits UI 设计稿索引与 Figma 节点约定）。实现或改版 UI 前应对照该文档中的链接与说明，避免脱离既定设计体系。

## Safety And Hygiene

- Do not commit local runtime data, memory stores, vector databases, credentials, or traces.
- Do not commit `.agent-memory/`, `.expcap/`, local SQLite files, Milvus Lite data, `.env`, or machine-specific paths.
- Keep examples sanitized: preserve the problem shape and reasoning, remove private project names, internal URLs, secrets, logs, IDs, and user data.
- Prefer small, reviewable edits over broad rewrites unless the task explicitly calls for a rewrite.
- Do not revert unrelated user changes.

## Writing Style

For public docs:

- Prefer concrete actions over slogans.
- Show the smallest usable workflow before the full theory.
- When introducing a concept like checkpoint, spec, codemap, or reverse sync, include a short example.
- Keep Chinese docs natural and readable; avoid making them sound like generated policy text.
